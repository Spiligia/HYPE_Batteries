To quick start this project frst read throught the software and hardware read me. One may want to test on the pre designed testbech and the schematic provided in the hardware read me will allow for easy hardware setup. 

To start this project one would want to produce and test the ideal diode design and the temperature sensing module. The next step is to take the information gained from that and iterate the designs. Then combine the temperature sensor data with the battery temp viewer to finalize the system for the client. 

If possible increase the voltage and currents to the full battery size and then design mechanical components to ensure isolation from the cabin and safety from factors like vibration and drops.
