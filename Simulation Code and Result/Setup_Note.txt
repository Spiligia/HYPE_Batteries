Set up:
In order to do the simulation, a notebook environment that can write and read Julia script is needed. After obtaining a coding environment like Jupyter notebook, the next steps are to obtain battery data specification sheets for the batteries you wish to simulate. These specification sheets must include: cell capacity, cell voltage, charge current, discharge current, weight, and discharge rate characteristics. The discharge rate characteristics need the voltage versus capacity relationship curves for different discharge rates. The discharge rate characteristics will help approximate the voltage versus capacity relationship curve for our desired discharge rate. Additionally, information about the aircraft being simulated will be needed, specifically: airplane mass, climb velocity, and glide ratio. These specifications will be used to determine the height of the aircraft during flight. Lastly, a diode will be needed in the circuit to prevent leakage current in the lithium-ion battery. This simulation will account for this, but value for diode voltage drop is required. 


Pre-testing Setup Procedures:
CSV File
Create a CSV file
Input 60 - 70 data points of battery capacity (Ah) with the corresponding voltage (V) for a specific discharge rate (C)
Need 3 - 5 different discharge rates
Diode Testing (If necessary)
Using a voltmeter, test the voltage across the two terminals to find the diode voltage drop

Testing Procedure:
Install Plots, CSV, DataFrames, and Interpolations packages into Julia environment
For each lithium ion battery type desired specification for testing
Import discharge rate CSV files
Input single cell capacity, single cell mass,single cell maximum discharge rate,and individual cell energy capacity
